                        Meat-free means that the food does not contain any meat, or ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements that people of certain diet do not consume, such as eggs, dairy / milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each specific shop / deal for further information.

                                    Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can obtain coupons for. Our coupons differ from other conventional deal sites in that you do not need to make any upfront payment at KindMeal, and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer, mobile or laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do not require advance reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon immediately! After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?

                                        Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet location (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get Coupon. Please note that the outlet location cannot be changed after the coupon is obtained.

Once you successfully share it, you will immediately receive the exclusive discount for your deal. If you prefer not to take advantage of KindWords, you can still proceed to get the deal at the normal discount price. Please note that not all deals support KindWords - it depends on the merchant.

                                                You should only activate the LiveCoupon when you are at the restaurant, and upon informing the merchant. Some merchants may require that you activate it during the ordering process, while some will be during the payment process. Please inform the merchant first when you are ordering to ensure they are aware of your KindMeal LiveCoupon.

                                                Once an active LiveCoupon is loaded, you will see a timer counting down the time remaining to use it. To activate it, click on Use LiveCoupon. Please ensure that you only activate it upon the request of the merchant. Activating it ahead of time may void your coupon and deal.                                        </div>

If there is a 3-Day delay, it means that you can only use the Print Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon.
